# DFA-to-CFG
Final Project from the Automatas Theory Subject, this repository aims to store the resources of a python program to realize the conversion from a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata) to CFG (Context Free Grammar). As a future goal, we have plans to turn this project into a Web App keeping the same functionality hosted with GitHub pages
